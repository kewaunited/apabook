# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
apartments = Apartment.create([{ name: 'Chocolate', door_number: '10', bedroom_count: 1, bathroom_count: 1, floor: 2 }, { name: 'Comfortable', door_number: '15', bedroom_count: 2, bathroom_count: 1, floor: 3 }, { name: 'Flower', door_number: '22', bedroom_count: 1, bathroom_count: 1, floor: 4 }])
